Purpose: just to show off my chicken and have a cool way to track how many eggs I've been getting

-----------------------

18th may - used v0 to bash out the basics of the website - vibe coding haha

what was included
- add and edit egg
    - if no eggs are recorded no chicken
- gallery of chickens
    - a lot of unneeded fields so i removed  alot

things you can do now
 - manually tweak the colour of the egg in the json haha, so you can have purple eggs appear

learning stuff
- learning to use React
- installed why-did-you-render
    - helps to detect unnecessary React component rerenders
    - haven't used it too indepth rn
- install ColorZilla on chrome to help pick out colours

fun ideas
 - accessorise the chickens
 - have random chickens appear
 - raining eggs
 - calendar view - more history avaliable
 - heatmap
 - create a miniblog on the devprocess ( basically what this should become)
 - mini games
 - add an associaton with the chickens - hard to tell who laid the egg tho so not too fesable
 - add quail eggs soon - check up in a few month
    - probably let people name them and have a cute little gallery going on
 - music and sound
 - weather and daylight hour sync to see if that has an effect
 - colour customisation - probably just a few presets in the future

 how will i update it?
 - manually edit the json and commit ? lmao
 - oooh notion intergration seems interesting to look into
